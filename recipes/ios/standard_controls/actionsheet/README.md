A UIActionSheet displays a list of buttons along with an optional title
to the user, animated from the bottom of the screen. They allow an application
to prompt a user for the action to take, such as confirming or canceling a
delete operation. They can also be customized to show a date picker in order to
prompt the user to select a date.
