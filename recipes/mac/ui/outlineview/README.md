title: Outline View
---

NSOutlineView derives from NSTableView and adds functionality to render hierarchal
data, as opposed to just grids. Out of the box, it provides indenting and expansion/collapse
functionality, as well as item selection, etc.

Working with the outline view is very similar to using a table view, except for the fact
that it has child-node functionality, due to it's hierarchal nature.
